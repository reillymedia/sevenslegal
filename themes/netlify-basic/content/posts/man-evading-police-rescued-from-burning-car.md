### Handling Traffic Violations

Minor and serious[traffic violations](http://sevenslegal.com/)are a part of our driving society and happen every day. You should know how to protect yourself from them, as well as how to legally protect yourself if you are facing serious charges.

The term “traffic violation” covers a wide variety of incidents. The main purpose that[traffic violations](http://sevenslegal.com/)are so closely regulated is to prevent unsafe driving while also educating and teaching bad drivers. As has been shown by years of research and proven facts, most people tend to be compliant with these regulations because they believe there is a chance they could be caught. This compliance often decreases when people perceive they will be able to get away with breaking the law. Below we outline what some of these traffic violations are and what you need to do if you face charges.

### Moving Violations And Non-Moving Violations

A moving violation ticket can be issued whenever a traffic law is violated by a vehicle in motion. Examples include: speeding, failure to yield, running a stop sign or red light, and drunk driving. Non-moving violation tickets can be issued for parking infringements or faulty equipment. Examples include: parking in a no parking zone, parking in front of a fire hydrant, broken tail-lights, and excessive muffler noise.

### How Traffic Tickets Are Processed

Most jurisdictions view the majority of traffic tickets as minor offenses, often called “infractions,” that only require you to pay administrative processing fees. Thus, they are not considered to be criminal cases, and you will not be subject to incarceration or large fines. You also will not be required to go to jury trial.

### Speeding Tickets

It should be noted that fines for speeding tickets, and unpaid speeding tickets can be very large and often times will require you to go before a jury trial. It’s important to know that the majority of traffic tickets are issued for what is termed a “strict-liability” offense, which means a person can be convicted regardless of if there is criminal intent or not. The only proof needed is that the person committed the act. Strict-liability offenses include:

* Speeding
* Not using turn signals
* Failing to yield to other traffic
* Turning into the wrong lane

Some traffic violations are considered more serious than small infractions and are considered serious traffic violations. These violations can be charged as misdemeanor crimes or felonies. Examples include the following.

### Reckless Driving And Excessive Speeding

A person can be convicted of reckless driving if he or she drives with “willful or wanton” disregard for the safety of others \[California Vehicle Code 23103\]. Being charged with reckless driving is a criminal offense. If convicted of this, it will be included on a criminal record, your driver’s license may be suspended, and you could be sentenced to serve time in county jail. To be convicted, the prosecution will need to prove you were driving with willful or wanton disregard for the safety of others. While speed alone is typically not enough to establish willful or wanton disregard, speeding while weaving in and out of traffic, driving aggressively, driving on the wrong side of the road, or engaging in other highly dangerous acts, means you could be found guilty of reckless driving.

### Driving Without insurance

If you have been caught driving without insurance, you could face some very heavy violation including suspension of your driver’s license and/or vehicle license. You can also receive a traffic ticket. Depending on the officer and the location you were pulled over, you might be able to have the ticket dismissed if you can prove you have insurancewithin a certain time period following the date of when you received the citation. This typically only applies if you actually have insurance, but for some reason do not have your insurance card with you. You might also face hefty fines for not having your insurance proof, or if you do not have insurance at all.

### Driving Without a License

When it comes to driving without a license, there are two categories you could fall into: correctable offenses and willful violations. A correctable offense could mean you simply forgot to take your driver’s license with you. This is typically treated with a “fix-it” ticket in which you must later show proof that you have a valid license. A willful violation carries much more serious consequences and occurs when a person is driving on a suspended or revoked license. Oftentimes licenses are suspended or revoked due to DUI and other moving violation offenses.

If you are found guilty of willfully driving with a suspended or revoked driver’s license you can be cited, arrested, and charged with a misdemeanor offense. In California, this violation can also result in: your car being impounded for 30 days and having to appear in court.

### Being Charged with a Serious Traffic Violation

If you have been accused of a serious traffic violation, you should know you areentitled to all constitutional protections provided to criminal defendants, including the right to a court-appointed attorney and a jury trial. At the Law Offices of Sevens Legal, APC, we help Southern California drivers who face driver’s license suspension or problems renewing a license due to multiple traffic violations or especially serious offenses.

### Avoiding Traffic Violations

Just because serious traffic violations happen often, that doesn’t mean they can’t be avoided or prevented. Below are some tips on how to be a good and cautious driver.

### Tips for Safe Driving

Here are some precautions to take to ensure good driving habits:

* Be cautious and alert.
* Practice extra precaution when approaching streets or busy intersections.
* Be extra aware of any pedestrians that might be entering the road or on the road (running or bicyclists).
* If driving at night, make sure all of your headlights and tail-lights are working, and that you are clearly visible to other cars and other people you are sharing the road with.
* Make sure your car is properly maintained. This includes frequent brake, light, and engine checks.
* Pay special attention when entering or exiting parking lots. In most of these cases you will need to cross a sidewalk to enter. This might mean there are pedestrians crossing in the way of the car.
* Follow posted speed limits.
* Avoid distractions including texting, phone calls, or reaching for things in your car.

### What To Do If You Are Pulled Over

If you are pulled over, there are some things you can do to help your position in challenging the ticket.

When you first see a police car following you with its emergency lights flashing and siren blaring, use your indicator and safely pull over to the right side of the road. Remember that the officer will be coming to the right side of the car, so ensure that he or she has enough room to stand by your car safely. This shows the officer you are compliant, but also stopping as soon as possible means you will have a good idea of where the infraction happened. This means you’ll be able to return to the same area later to record the details, including what the posted speed limits are, where the turn occurred, etc.

Next, roll your window down all the way. Turn off the engine, and place your hands on the steering wheel. If it’s night-time, turn on your interior light. An officer wants to feel as safe as possible walking up to your car. Show them you are respectful for this. Do not reach into your back pocket for your wallet, or into your glove compartment for your registration, until the officer asks you for them. There have been incidents where people posing as police officers have pulled over innocent people. If you fear this is the case, ask to see the officer’s photo identification along with his badge. You can also ask for the officer to call a supervisor to the scene or request that you be allowed to follow the officer to a police station. A police officer cannot search your vehicle unless you give them probable cause by either hiding or throwing something under the seat or out your window. Any movement you do while a police officer approaches the car could give them cause to want to search your car.

Additionally, if an officer has reasonable suspicion that you might be armed or dangerous, they are allowed to frisk you. Additionally, a police officer can seize any illegal objects, such as open beers or drug paraphernalia, in your car that are in “plain view.” If you or any or the car’s occupants are arrested for probable cause, the officer might also search the car. This can also be done if the car is towed.

#### A police officer is allowed to make an “inventory search” afterward, even if they had no initial reason to suspect there is anything illegal inside.
