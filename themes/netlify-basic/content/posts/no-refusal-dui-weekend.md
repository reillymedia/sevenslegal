Over the past year some states pushed for what’s referred to as [“no refusal” DUI stops](https://www.sevenslegal.com/san-diego-dui-defense-lawyer/ "San Diego DUI Defense Lawyer"). But what is a “no refusal” DUI stop and does the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration support it?

## “No Refusal” DUI Weekend

Over the past year some states pushed for what’s referred to as [“no refusal” DUI stops](https://www.sevenslegal.com/san-diego-dui-defense-lawyer/ "San Diego DUI Defense Lawyer"). But what is a “no refusal” DUI stop and does the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration support it?

## Suspicion of DUI

When a person is stopped for suspicion of DUI, an officer will usually administer a group of field sobriety tests (“FSTs”). This is followed with a breathalyzer test that measures blood alcohol concentration (“BAC”) in the driver’s blood. A driver is allowed to refuse field sobriety tests on the grounds that the officer needs a warrant to perform them. However, the penalty for refusing them is usually an automatic suspension of their driver’s license.

### Weekend of “No Refusal”

During [“No Refusal” Weekends](https://www.sevenslegal.com/san-diego-dui-defense-lawyer/ "San Diego DUI Defense Lawyer"), police officers can require drivers who refuse to take a breathalyzer test to submit to blood tests. This essentially eliminates their option to refuse having their blood alcohol content measured.

### Is a “No Refusal” Weekend Legal?

During “No Refusal” Weekends, judges would be on call in order to issue warrants using a smartphone or vi computer if a driver refuses. The NHTSA believes this program will help facilitate judges’ and magistrates’ availability to quickly issue warrants for officers to administer blood tests.

A driver can still refuse the blood test, but under this program they will be in violation of a judge’s issued warrant, which can lead to other serious criminal charges, including contempt of court.
