[Tom Hanks](https://www.sevenslegal.com/) and Rita Wilson have been sued for their “involvement” in their 25-year-old son’s alleged DUI. But can they legally be charged?

## Can Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson Be Charged for Son’s Alleged DUI?

[Tom Hanks](https://www.sevenslegal.com/) and Rita Wilson have been sued for their “involvement” in their 25-year-old son’s alleged DUI. But can they legally be charged?

## Can Actor Tom Hanks and Wife Rita Wilson Be Charged for Their Son’s Alleged DUI?

Terry Moogan has filed court papers against actor Tom Hanks and his wife Rita Wilson for their son, [Chet Hank](https://www.sevenslegal.com/)‘s alleged involvement in a car accident involving a DUI. Moogan is claiming that Hanks and Wilson are responsible because they allowed Chet Hanks to drive their car while he, according to Moogan, was “under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol” during a February 25th car accident in which Moogan suffered whiplash and a brain injury after hitting his head on the dashboard.

The lawsuit claims, “Despite knowing that [Chester Hanks](https://www.sevenslegal.com/) was a careless and reckless driver and a habitual user of drugs and alcohol, they negligently permitted Chester Hanks to operate their vehicle.”

As Chet Hanks admitted in a series of Instagram videos, “A couple of months ago, I was selling coke, doing coke until I couldn’t even snort it up my nose anymore because it was so clogged. If I can change, you can change. There is a solution.”

In another post he states, “I’ve been in rehab. I’ve been trying to get my s–t together, and I’m doing pretty damn good.”

And on January 29 he announced that he had hit his six-month sobriety mark, tweeting: “Blessings are happening all around me,” he tweeted.

### Does Moogan Have a Case?

While Moogan has claimed that Hanks was under the influence, police were not called to the scene and Hanks was never charged with driving under the influence. That means that there is no record of Hanks being under the influence at the time of the accident.

Additionally, [Hanks](https://www.sevenslegal.com/) is 25 years old – far over the age of 18 at which his father and mother might run the risk of being sued.

State laws vary when it comes to a parent’s liability for their child’s harmful actions, but typically that can only be used for an underage child, or one that is considered to be a legal dependent (if over the age of 18). This most likely does not apply to Hanks, who has an established career of his own, and thus is not likely considered a dependent.

While Moogan might be able to claim that [Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson](https://www.sevenslegal.com/) should have not allowed their son to drive their car knowing that he had past issues with drug use, the case he is trying to bring is very weak in a lot of areas.

Still, DUI allegations should not be handled lightly, and if you have been accused of driving under the influence, even if there was no report filed, you should still contact a DUI attorney.

### Steps to Investigating Typical DUI Charges

The first step in a DUI investigation is being pulled over by a police officer, which can be scary. The first thought you might have is when is the officer going to ask, “Have you had anything to drink today?”

Since the officer can’t force you to answer any questions that could be considered incriminating, the best answer might be to tell them you prefer to speak with a DUI attorney before answering their questions. Having a blood alcohol (“BAC”) content under 0.08 is not considered driving under the influence. Admitting that you may have had one beer just explains why your breath smells of alcohol.

The second step in a DUI investigation are field sobriety tests. California does not give you the right to consult an attorney prior to these tests, but you can still politely decline to take them since you are not legally required to submit to these tests. The risk of these tests is that if an officer takes a subjective view they could decide you failed even though the test results were borderline. These results could then be used to convict you for a DUI. However, if a police officer genuinely suspects you are intoxicated, chances are good you won’t get away with a warning.

The next step in a DUI investigation is the Preliminary Alcohol Screening (PAS) test. This test is normally a breathalyzer test, which is a chemical test prior to being arrested. A breathalyzer test is the most common one used by police officers to identify drivers driving under the influence. Breathalyzer tests are also used after an arrest as well. Before actually being arrest, you have the right to refuse to take the breathalyzer test. If you are afraid your blood alcohol level is high, you can take it knowing the possibility exists of later impeaching the test results.

If you have been lawfully arrested for DUI, the law requires you to undergo the administration of a chemical test by a police officer to determine your blood alcohol level (“BAC”).

According to California’s “Implied Consent Law,” you are required to submit to chemical testing to determine your BAC if a police officer arrests you for DUI and the officer has probable cause to believe you were driving under the influence.

After being arrested, often you can chose either the breathalyzer or chemical tests. The breathalyzer is fairly reliable, but the results aren’t for a number of reasons. Breathalyzer tests don’t test for blood alcohol concentration (“BAC”), which requires a blood sample be taken to be analyzed. Because of this, the police will indirectly make an estimate of your BAC.

### Blood Test to Confirm DUI

The most accurate tests to determine BAC are blood tests. Because of this, if given the choice you should choose a blood test if you feel your BAC is under the legal limit of 0.8. Also, your blood sample must be preserved under a specific set of rules that will then be available for your attorney’s use in order for their later independent testing and analysis.

Although you can’t be forced to take a chemical blood test, if you refuse the Department of Motor Vehicles will suspend your California Driver’s License for one year, no matter what the outcome of the DUI case against you. You can request a hearing to contest the suspension, but it must be requested within 10 days from your DUI arrest date.
