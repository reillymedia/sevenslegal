## White Collar Crimes

What Are White Collar Crimes?

In California,[white collar crimes](https://www.sevenslegal.com/)fall under the prosecution of the District Attorney, Federal Government, or local prosecutor’s office. These crimes are mostly non-violent crimes involving money or property that have been entrusted into an employee’s hands. The most common white collar crime is embezzlement, which usually involves charging a person in an organization who is in a position of trust. Frequently these persons are accountants, bookkeepers, payroll accountants, and similar persons dealing with a company’s financial matters.

White collar crimes, like other types of crime, are charged the same. Persons allegedly accused of these types of crimes have the same protection and legal defense as in other crimes. The difference is that the legal theories and principles are more complicated and require vast amounts of paper and other documents as evidence. Many times the suspect of the criminal investigation will make what they consider an innocent statement, not realizing that this statement may seal their fate. Unless the alleged suspect makes a statement, the investigators aren’t able to show the intent or mental state required to press charges. Many times the alleged suspects are subpoenaed by a grand jury in order testify about any involvement in the particular white collar crime. In order to protect their rights, they should have proper legal representation by a white collar crime defense attorney.

### The “Arrest to Expungement” Criminal Process

The punishments for white collar crimes can vary depending on the type. Depending on the seriousness of the fraud, or how complicated the illegal plan was, chances are likely the government will want to impose extensive prison time.

Whether a white collar crime is charged as a felony or misdemeanor, the process of how it’s treated is usually the same. The investigation of fraud cases usually take a significant period of time before the case is referred to prosecutors for criminal filing. Because of this, a defense attorney experienced with white collar crimes can intervene before charges are filed in an effort to reduce the charges or even stop the charges from being filed.

Once the investigation has been completed, the police normally will request an arrest warrant. If a judge decides that probable cause for the crime exists, the warrant will be issued. Once the warrant has been served and the person is in custody, they will remain there until they have posted bail.

The prosecutor will usually file a motion, as established in Penal Code Section 1275, which requires that the prosecutor inspect where the money is coming from that will be used to post bail. It stipulates that the bail money must not come from illegally obtained funds or from money associated with the alleged embezzlement or theft by false pretenses.

After the alleged suspect has posted bail and been released, the court will schedule a date for an arraignment, which is the hearing where the judge will formally let the alleged suspect know the charges against them in the complaint, which has been filed by the prosecutor. Once the charges have been given, the person is asked to enter a guilty or not guilty plea. If the plea is not guilty, the case proceeds to the next stage. During the arraignment, the bail will also be discussed.

Once the arraignment is over, if the case has been charged as a felony the judge will either set the case for an early disposition court or a preliminary hearing. If it’s charged as a misdemeanor, the judge will set it for pre-trial in order for the discovery process to begin.

With a felony, the preliminary hearing must happen within ten days after the arraignment. At this hearing, evidence will be provided and the judge will decide if there is enough probable cause to establish that a crime was committed. The judge will also decide if the person who has been charged is the alleged suspect who committed the white collar crime.

If the judge decides there is probable cause for the charge, the case will proceed to the felony arraignment phase ten days after the preliminary hearing has been completed. At the arraignment at the Superior Court the felony charges will be listed and the defendant is given their constitutional rights and formally given the charges against them. At this point the defendant enters another plea of guilty or not guilty. Bail will again be addressed, and a date will be set for trial within 60 says.

The next court appearance is what’s called a pre-trial conference, where the prosecution, the defense, and judge, meet and discuss the case. Plea negotiations and any additional discovery is shared between opposing counsels. It’s possible to resolve the case at this point, but otherwise it will move forward to the actual trial.

The jury trial is where 12 jurors decide if the charges are valid. Whether the case is charged as a misdemeanor or felony the defendant is entitled to a trial by jury. After all the admissible evidence has been presented, the jury will decide on the guilt or innocence of the person charged with the crime. In order for the person to be found guilty, all 12 jurors must unanimously agree, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant committed the crime.

If found guilty, a sentencing trial will be set for the defendant, where their punishment will be imposed by the court.

If the jurors do not vote unanimously, the judge will determine the case to be hung, and at his discretion may either decide to retry the case or dismiss it.

If the jurors unanimously agree that the defendant did not commit the crime, or the prosecutor did not prove their case, the defendant will be found innocent, or not guilty, and the case will end.

If the verdict is guilty, the defendant’s case can be appealed to a higher court on legal or procedural grounds. If the conviction is upheld, after serving a certain amount of time and/or serving a probationary period, the defendant may request the charges be expunged. This means a judge can reverse their guilty verdict and discuss the case under Penal Code Section 1203.4.
