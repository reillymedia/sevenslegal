According to the California Highway Patrol, arrests for DUI during the holiday season were markedly higher in 2017 than in 2016.

## Higher DUI Incidents in 2017

Higher Incidents of DUI in 2017

The CHP reported DUIs spiked dramatically during the 2017 holiday season. Across California, the CHP arrested 936 people for driving under the influence between the evening of Dec. 29 and Jan. 1. That number was 767 in 2016, marking a 22% increase.

“Anytime you see a rise it’s concerning, especially when we look at fatalities because that’s somebody’s loved one,” said CHP Officer John Fransen. “But the sheer number of arrests that are made, to see roughly 1,000 people arrested in every single maximum enforcement period, it’s disheartening.”

These numbers represent only drivers that received tickets from the CHP, and does not include citations issued by California’s local law enforcement agencies.

During maximum enforcement periods, which usually occur during holidays, the CHP has more officers on the road. It’s unclear why there were more arrests made in 2017. “I would just be guessing” why there was an increase, Fransen said. “It’s not necessarily that there are more officers, because anytime there’s a maximum enforcement period, any available officers are on the road. It could be that more people are choosing to get behind the wheel of a vehicle and think that they can drive after they’ve had a few too many drinks.”

Many of the arrests made at the end of 2017 are still pending investigation and the statistics are still unknown regarding whether those arrested were under the influence of alcohol, drugs or both.

The CHP and the California Office of Traffic Safety have partnered together for a public information campaign to educate people about driving under the influence of drugs. Now that marijuana has become legal across the state, driving under the influence of the drug has become a larger concern for law enforcement.

According to statistics from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, from 2005 to 2015, the percentage of drivers in fatal collisions who had an impairing drug other than alcohol in their system (meaning marijuana, opioids, or preseciprtion drugs) increased from 26.2 percent to 42.6 percent.

“I think our biggest concern as we look at the statistics on other states that have legalized recreational marijuana, it seems like there’s a sharp increase in DUI-related traffic collisions and fatalities,” Fransen said. “We’re concerned because obviously we don’t want to see California follow that strong trend.”
