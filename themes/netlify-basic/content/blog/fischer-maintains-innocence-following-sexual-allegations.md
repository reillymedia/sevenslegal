## Fischer Maintains Innocence Following Sexual Allegations

Following Allegations of Sexual Assault Fischer Maintains Innocence

“I’m definitely eager to get started. I feel like, right now, the only way to clear my name is through a jury trial. I am definitely looking forward to that,” said Fischer at a recent court appearance.

The first allegation surfaced just a little over a year ago. The 32-year-old deputy has been accused of groping and fondling victims while he was on-duty. He has been ordered to stand trial on one case involving 13 women and a second case involving three more women, including one accusation of sexually assaulting woman in her home.

“These false allegations have turned my client’s life upside down. The allegations are false, they are bogus, they are contrived. He is presumed innocent,” said Manny Medrano, Fischer’s attorney.

Medrano may also motion to move the trial out of San Diego due to all the negative pre-trial publicity.

“That decision is going to be made very shortly and if the judge agrees with me and changes the venue, we could be trying this case in several counties that are immediately adjacent to San Diego County,” Medrano explained.

### Fischer’s Work as a Deputy

The deputy served eight years in the United States Marine Corps Reserve and was deployed to Afghanistan. According to Fischer, he has made more than 700 arrests during his time in law enforcement.

“It’s not just a job, it’s a calling,” Fischer said of his work as a sheriff’s deputy. Fischer has always maintained that the charges against him are false.

### What is “Sexual Assault”

Sexual assault is defined as any type of sexual contact or behavior that occurs without the explicit consent of a recipient. Included under the term sexual assault are the following: forced sexual intercourse, forcible sodomy, child molestation, incest, fondling, and attempted rape.

### What is Rape? Penal Code Section 261 PC

When they hear the term rape, many people create a mental image of an assault committed by means of violent physical force. The reality is, however, that rape is any non-consensual sexual activity, including those accomplished without physical means, using such methods as drugs or guile. Any form of sexual conduct forced on a person against their will through means of violence, menace, duress, fear of injury, or other danger is rape under California law.

There are a number of statutes in California that pertain to rape, all of which are among the most serious of criminal offenses with which an individual can be charged.

The most common type of rape (Penal Code Section 261 PC) is defined as criminal offense that involves nonconsensual sexual intercourse by means of threats, force, or fraud. At its core, this form of rape involves vaginal or anal penetration that includes force by instrumentation on someone, conscious or unconscious, or on any victim unable to consent.

### Date Rape

Date rape charges are also filed under Penal Code Section 261 PC. Cases of this nature can sometimes be highly contested between the victim and the accused with the difference between a conviction and an acquittal depending on who the jury believes. The question of if sex took place is often not questioned, but rather was the sex consensual or not? Most of these cases do not involve force or injury to the victim. Often, they are cases of “he said, she said” with the defendant having the greatest stake in the outcome.

### Other Forms of Rape:

* Penal Code 262 PC “Spousal Rape.”
* Penal Code 261.5 PC “Statutory Rape.”

Other forms of rape warrant their own specific statutes in state law. Examples include:

* Penal Code 262 PC “Spousal Rape.” Anyone who has intercourse with their spouse without their consent and does so with force or threat, and for sexual pleasure or arousal, is guilty of violating California Penal Code 262.
* Penal Code 261.5 PC “Statutory Rape.” Anyone who knowingly has intercourse with a minor can be found guilty of Statutory Rape. A minor is defined as anyone under the age of 18.

### Penalties for Rape

Rape is one of the most serious criminal charges that a defendant may face. A case may be highly complex because of circumstances that are difficult to explain and understand. The penalties for these offenses are harsh and conviction includes lifetime sex offender registration.

### Addressing False Rape Accusations

Sexual assault crimes are taken very seriously by the law. If you have been falsely accused you might assume that the charges will just be dropped because of how ludicrous they are to you. But take this case for example – and the wide-reaching effects that it had on just members of the fraternity associated with the rape allegations. These types of allegations do not just “go away,” and you will need to be prepared if you are falsely accused.

Here are some things you can do:

1. Do not speak with police or investigators until you have contacted a criminal defense attorney. They might try different tactics to get you to admit to a crime you did not commit. Remember that they are always trying to build a case. Simply state that you will not speak with them unless there is an attorney present.
2. Get in touch with a qualified and experienced criminal defense attorney. You’ll want to do this as soon as possible, even if you just expect the charges to be dismissed.
3. Prepare for what the allegations might bring. You will be asked to defend yourself, so you’ll need to be prepared. This means contacting witnesses that can testify or provide an alibi for you. You might also need to take psychological tests, or be asked to provide other evidence. Write down as many details as possible about what you remember.
4. Study. A criminal defense attorney will be able to guide you through fighting the allegations, but it’s in your best interest to understand the legal process and know your rights.

You will want to follow all the legal rules and precautions you can, and the best way you can protect yourself is by working with an experienced defense attorney such as Sevens Legal, APC.

### If You Get Arrested for a Sex Crime

In 1966, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Miranda v. Arizona, that individuals arrested because they are believed to have committed a crime are allowed certain rights that must be explained to them. This must happen before any interrogation. It’s important to note that these rights only need to be read when a person has been taken into custody. “Miranda Rights” are meant to protect a suspect from self-incrimination and is protected under the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Those “Miranda Rights” are as follows:

* You have the right to remain silent and refuse to answer questions.
* Anything you say may be used against you in a court of law.
* You have the right to consult an attorney before speaking to the police and to have an attorney present during questioning now or in the future.
* If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed for you before any questioning if you wish.
* If you decide to answer questions now without an attorney present, you will still have the right to stop answering at any time until you talk to an attorney. Knowing and understanding your rights as I have explained them to you, are you willing to answer my questions without an attorney present?
