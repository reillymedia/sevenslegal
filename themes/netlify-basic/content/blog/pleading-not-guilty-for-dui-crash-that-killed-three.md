The woman charged with murder and driving under the influence (“DUI”) has pleaded not guilty. The March 29 crash for which she is accused killed three teenagers.

## Pleading Not Guilty for DUI Crash that Killed Three

DUI Crash Killed Three – Duarte Pleading Not Guilty

Bani Duarte, 27, was charged with three counts of murder and one count of driving under the influence causing injury for a March 29 crash that left three teens dead. She also faces a possible sentencing enhancement on allegations of inflicting great bodily injury.

If Duarte is convicted, she could be sentenced to 51 years to life in state prison.

Duarte was taken into custody on a $5-million warrant after investigators determined she may have been a flight risk. A hearing is set to review her bail amount.

Duarte was initially arrested after the March crash on suspicion of driving under the influence. She was also facing charges of gross vehicular manslaughter. At that time she posted $100,000 bail.

“As the investigation continued, more evidence was obtained,” authorities say. “Investigators received information the female driver was possibly intending on fleeing the country to avoid prosecution.”

Authorities allege Duarte was traveling north on PCH in a Hyundai Sonata when she rear-ended the teens’ Toyota, which was stopped at a red light at an intersection.

The impact pushed the Toyota through the intersection and into a pole, causing the car to burst into flames.
