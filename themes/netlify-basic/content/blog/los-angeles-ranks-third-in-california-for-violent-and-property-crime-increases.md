According to recently released data from the FBI and the Public Policy Institute of California ([PPIC](https://www.sevenslegal.com/)), Los Angeles ranked third out of 25 for violent and [property crime](https://www.sevenslegal.com/) increases for the first half of 2015.

## Los Angeles Ranks Third in California for Violent and Property Crime Increases

Los Angeles Third in Violent Property Crime Comparison

According to the data from Public Policy Institute of California (PPIC), rankings for violent-crime listed Sacramento for first place, Long Beach for fifth place, and San Francisco took eighth place.

“However,” the PPIC says its analysis, “the data also show that cities in other states are also experiencing increases, especially in violent crime.”

### Why? Proposition 47

This data calls into question the fact that California’s voter-approved [Proposition 47](https://www.sevenslegal.com/) might be to blame for the ranking. [Proposition 47](https://www.sevenslegal.com/) was the ballot initiative passed by California voters on November 4, 2014 that reduced some drug possession felonies to misdemeanors. It also requires that petty theft, receiving stolen property, and forging bad checks when the amount involved is $950 or less are charged as misdemeanors. This update to criminal law could be the reason behind these numbers.

Still, according to the [PPIC](https://www.sevenslegal.com/), the data “are a strong indication that recent crime increases have occurred across the state.”

“They underscore the importance of monitoring crime trends and the need for careful analysis to identify key causes. If we can identify the factors that are contributing to higher crime rates, we can implement effective crime-preventive strategies.”

### Accused of Committing a Crime Such as a Property Crime

Whether it be criminal charges, or simply being pulled over for speeding, chances are if you haven’t had an interaction with a police officer, at some point you will. It can be scary, and often feel as if you are assumed guilty – even for minor infractions. Because of that, it’s important to know that you have legal rights that protect you.

From the moment those lights turn on, or you get the knock on the door, you immediately start questioning what you did wrong and how you are going to prove you are innocent. It’s important to remain calm and act politely.

On TV, or in movies, you often hear that a police officer needs a “search warrant” to enter a home. That’s exactly correct. A search warrant allows an officer the legal right to enter a home or business to look for evidence. Typically a search warrant will include everything contained in the property’s perimeter, including outbuildings and automobiles that are on the property.

An officer is required to knock, announce himself, and use force to enter unless the warrant specifically states the officer can make an unannounced entry. Also, a police officer does not have to “wait” for admittance by the occupant.

The police officer also does not need to display the warrant to the occupant or owner before entering.

Under the search warrant, an officer cannot search the person of anyone found on the premises unless there is reasonable cause to believe that person is engaged in criminal activity or poses a threat to officer safety.

### Grounds for Police Issuing Search Warrant

Under California law, these are the requirements for issuing a search warrant:

* The [property](https://www.sevenslegal.com/) was stolen or embezzled
* The property to be seized is evidence that a felony has occurred or that a particular person has committed a felony
* The property is child pornography
* There is a warrant to arrest a person
* The property to be seized is in possession of someone who intends to use it to commit a crime, or the property is in possession of another person to whom he/she may have delivered it for the purpose of concealing it or keeping it from being discovered
* A firearm or other deadly weapon was used at the scene of a crime
* A mentally disturbed person is in possession of a firearm
* A person subject to a protective order or restraining order is in possession of a firearm and refuses to relinquish it
* During an investigation of certain misdemeanor crimes where a felony is also suspected
* An investigator has shown probable cause to a judge.

A Note About Exemptions: Attorneys, doctors, psychologists, and clergy are exempt from searches of professional records that might be in their possession unless they are suspected of criminal activity themselves.

### Miranda Rights and Police

In 1966, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Miranda v. Arizona, that individuals arrested because they are believed to have committed a crime are allowed certain rights that must be explained to them. This must happen before any interrogation. It’s important to note that these rights only need to be read when a person has been taken into custody. “Miranda Rights” are meant to protect a suspect from self-incrimination and is protected under the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Those “Miranda Rights” are as follows:

* You have the right to remain silent and refuse to answer questions.
* Anything you say may be used against you in a court of law.
* You have the right to consult an attorney before speaking to the police and to have an attorney present during questioning now or in the future.
* If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed for you before any questioning if you wish.
* If you decide to answer questions now without an attorney present, you will still have the right to stop answering at any time until you talk to an attorney.
* Knowing and understanding your rights as I have explained them to you, are you willing to answer my questions without an attorney present?

### Interrogations by Police

Regardless of if you are informally interrogated by a police officer (such as during a pullover for a traffic violation) or formally interrogated for a crime, remember that there are specific laws that protect you. An officer will use any number of tactics to get a confession from you, regardless of you are guilty or not. It has been shown in clinical research that these tactics are effective in getting confessions from people who are later exonerated by DNA, and thus have always been innocent.

There are two key things to remember if you are being interrogated:

* Interrogations are set up and conducted to produce confessions – even from the innocent
* The best way to protect yourself is to remain quiet about anything. Do not make a statement without first talking to a criminal defense attorney. The best way to not incriminate yourself is to not say anything at all.

### If You End Up In Jail for a Crime Such as a Property Crime

If you are detained in jail, remember there are still ways to incriminate yourself. There are some general guidelines you should follow, including the following:

* Do not discuss anything over the phone. This is often recorded and can be overheard.
* Do not discuss with fellow in-mates. Remember that anyone in jail is looking for a way out. That could include providing information about you in order to improve their position with the state.
* Do not make statements or answer questions without an attorney present.
* Never waive your rights to something without first speaking with an attorney.
* Know how to be steadfast with your requirement that an attorney be present during any interrogation or questioning.

### Jail and Bond

Unless you are dealing with a minor charge, your bond will probably not be set until you appear before a judge during an arraignment. An arraignment is the first part of courtroom-based proceedings. This is what happens during an arraignment:

* The person charged goes before a criminal court judge
* The judge reads the charges against the person
* The judge asks the person if he or she has an attorney or if they need the assistance of a court-appointed attorney
* The judge asks the person if they will plead “guilty,” “not guilty,” or “no contest.”
* The judge sets a bail amount, if necessary
* The judge announces the date of the future proceedings, such as a preliminary hearing, pre-trial motion, or trial.

During an arraignment, you want to make sure you have the best possible outcome from your case. Ensure that you understand everything that you are being charged with. Make sure you have received counsel.
