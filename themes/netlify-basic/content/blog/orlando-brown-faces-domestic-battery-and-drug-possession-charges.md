## Orlando Brown Faces Domestic Battery and Drug Possession Charges

Orlando Brown Faces Charges for Domestic Battery and Drug Possession

According to the Los Angeles District Attorney’s Office, Brown, 28, was arrested by officers with the Torrance Police Department after he allegedly struck his girlfriend.

The incident occurred in the parking lot of the Torrance, California police station. A witness supposedly saw Brown hit his girlfriend and immediately called the police – who were, obviously, right there.

### Charges

Brown was charged with possessing and bringing methamphetamine into police headquarters, possessing drug paraphernalia, battery, and resisting or delaying arrest.

Brown, who was also in the film “Straight Outta Compton,” went on to deny the allegations, posting a series of videos and photographs to his Instagram. He later made the postings private.

The drug counts are being charged as felonies, while the battery and delaying arrest charges are being charged as misdemeanors. The hearing is set for March 28.

### Previous Issues

This is far from Brown’s first interaction with the law. In August 2014, he threatened to kill a woman and her daughter. He was able to strike a plea deal in that case.

In order to get a reduced sentence, your criminal defense lawyer with help negotiate a “deal” or “plea bargain” with the prosecutor. In some cases it will not only reduce your sentence but in many cases may even eliminate some if not all the charges against you. If the court finds you guilty of the charges, a criminal defense lawyer may be able to negotiate lesser time served or a rehabilitation program which can help prevent you winding up in the criminal justice system again. When discussing your case, your criminal defense lawyer can advise the best way to go in order to reduce your sentence. Sometimes pleading guilty can result in your having a shorter sentence.

Prior to arrest in August 2014, Brown was arrested for a DUI in 2013. In 2012 he went to jail for violating probation terms. Additionally, he was arrested in 2011 for a DUI and also went to jail in 2007 for marijuana possession.

### Battery, and the Difference Between Assault and Battery

Brown has been recently charged for battery, but it’s important to understand the difference between assault, assault and battery, or aggravated assault. While they all involve one person doing intentional harm to another person, crimes involving physical attacks can be assaults or batteries or both. Depending on the seriousness of the attack, charges can be elevated to the most serious one of aggravated assault.

### What is “Assault”

Assault is defined as the intentional act of causing another person to be afraid they are going to experience physical harm. While this is a broad definition, since actual physical harm doesn’t have to be involved, assault is the fact that a person fears imminent harm from another person. The broadness of this definition permits the police to intervene to prevent any actual harm to the person.

### What is “Assault and Battery”

Assault and battery were originally considered to be separate crimes. While assault is the fear of impending physical harm, battery is defined as the actual physical harm done to a victim. While “assault” can be considered the beginning, “battery” can be consider the ending. Most statutes now do not make a distinction between these two offenses.

### What is “Simple” and “Aggravated Assault”

Depending on the seriousness of the potential harm that may occur to a victim, many states make a distinction between “simple” and “aggravated assault.” Aggravated assault is a felony which may involve an assault with a weapon, or the intention to commit a serious crime. It can also be classified as aggravated assault if there is any legally regarded “special protection” relationship involved. If the assault is classified as simple assault its usually charged as a misdemeanor. In some states the seriousness of the assault may be classified as “first,” “second,” or “third” degree assaults, in which case a “first” degree assault is the most serious one.

### Additional Drug Charges for Brown

In addition to battery charges, Brown also faces drug possession charges.
