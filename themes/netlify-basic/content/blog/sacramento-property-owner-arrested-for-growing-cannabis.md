Property Owner Growing Cannabis Arrested in Sacramento

According to city officials Lisa Ung, 63, allegedly maintained eight homes across Sacramento for the purpose of growing more than 4,000 marijuana plants.

Ung was arraigned on five counts of maintaining a place to furnish a controlled substance. Her bail was posted at $50,000.

Under state law, California residents are legally able to grow up to six cannabis plants. If they want to grow more for selling purposes, they must obtain city and state permits.

“The scale of the illegal grow houses and the fire danger and criminal danger they present to neighborhoods is a real threat,” said city spokeswoman Linda Tucker.

### Where are you able to smoke marijuana in California?

A good rule of thumb across the state is that you can’t smoke pot anywhere they can’t smoke a cigarette. You cannot smoke in indoor places, including bars, cars, or other moving vehicles. Having an open bag in the car is illegal. If you are renting, you will need to check with your landlord to see if smoking is allowed inside your rental property.

Prop 64, which made marijuana legal, does however open the door for local governments to permit marijuana consumption at retailers and companies with a microbusiness license, which combines a small cultivation site, distribution and retail. In that case, the business will be required to restrict the premises to people 21 and older, cannot allow alcohol or tobacco use on site and also must ensure no one can see people consuming marijuana from outside.

California is one of two-dozen states that have legalized marijuana for medical use. Recreational use of marijuana is still illegal in the state of California and possessing marijuana or intent to sell marijuana can carry heavy convictions. Although sentencing for marijuana has been pulled back in recent years, one ounce of marijuana or 28.5 grams is an infraction; police often get around this provision by charging minor offenders with felony intent to sell. You may find yourself being charged with intent to sell if you have cash, scales, and large amounts of marijuana or marijuana in bags on your persons. Due to proposition 36 and other legislation, if you are convicted of a misdemeanor marijuana charge you may find yourself paying a small fine. Charges are often reduced or dropped for first time offenders with the help of a criminal defense attorney.
