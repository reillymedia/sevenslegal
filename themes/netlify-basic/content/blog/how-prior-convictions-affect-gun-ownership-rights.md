## How Prior Convictions Affect Gun Ownership Rights

The Second Amendment of the United States Constitution guarantees the right to bear arms, but there are various things that can forfeit a person’s [gun ownership rights](https://www.sevenslegal.com/ "Sevens Legal, APC").

## California Penal Code 29800 and Gun Ownership Rights

[California Penal Code Section 29800 PC](https://www.sevenslegal.com/ "Sevens Legal, APC") states that any person convicted under United States, California, or “any other state, government, or country,” of a felony and some misdemeanors forfeits their [gun ownership rights](https://www.sevenslegal.com/ "Sevens Legal, APC"). This includes anybody addicted to narcotic drugs, a juvenile who has been tried as an adult in adult court and convicted, or anybody incarcerated in a federal correctional facility for 30 days or received a fine of over $1000 or both.

### Specific Groups Without Gun Ownership Rights

The following three groups are not permitted to own or carry firearms:

* Any person convicted of a felony loses their [gun ownership rights](https://www.sevenslegal.com/ "Sevens Legal, APC") and is prohibited from possessing, purchasing, owning, or receiving a firearm. If found guilty under Penal Code Section 29800 they can be sentenced to prison for up to three years.


* You can be charged with a misdemeanor or felony under California Penal Code Section 29805 for possessing a firearm within 10 years of being convicted of another felony or misdemeanor such as criminal threats of domestic violence. This also applies to misdemeanors or felonies such as “Brandishing a Weapon,” “Assault with a Deadly Weapon,” and various sex crimes.


* Anybody addicted to narcotics forfeits their [gun ownership rights](https://www.sevenslegal.com/ "Sevens Legal, APC"). Being “addicted to narcotics” includes: (1) anybody emotionally dependent on a drug with a compulsive need to use it; (2) anybody with a tolerance to the effects of the drug requiring them to use larger doses; and (3) anybody who is physically dependent on a drug to the point where they would suffer withdrawal symptoms if deprived of it.

Anybody in one of the above groups can have their [gun ownership rights](https://www.sevenslegal.com/ "Sevens Legal, APC") revoked for 10 years or more if they own, purchase, receive, or possess a gun. Some cases can also revoke these rights for life. Juveniles in violation of [California Penal Code Section 29800](https://www.sevenslegal.com/ "Sevens Legal, APC") will have their gun ownership rights revoked until they’re 30.
