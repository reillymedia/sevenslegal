It doesn’t matter the length of time in the U.S., how established they are, or whether they have dependent children who are U.S. citizens. Whether they are legal permanent residents, have a green card, visa, or have been granted asylum, they’ll be deported if they commit any crime in the “Deportable Crimes” categories.

* “Crimes of moral turpitude” (CIMT). These crimes include rape, arson, or murder. If you’re convicted of one of these crimes and sentenced to one or more years in prison within five years after being admitted to the U.S. you may be deported. If you have a green card, this is within 10 years of being admitted to the U.S.


* “Aggravated felonies.” This includes drug or firearms trafficking, murder, or rape. You may be deported for this crime no matter how long it’s been since being admitted to the U.S.
