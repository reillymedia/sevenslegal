## Conspiracy to Distribute and Other Drug Charges

What is a Conspiracy to Distribute?

When a person has been charged with “Conspiracy to Possess with Intent to Distribute” there are usually multiple violations that have occurred. This charge means the defendant played an active role along with another person in the planning of possessing or distributing an illegal controlled substance.

The addition of a second person – seen as a collaboration – is the reason that the word “conspiracy” is used. While it only takes two or more people to receive the conspiracy, it should be noted that in a conspiracy charge a crime does not actually have ti take place. The prosecution will only need to show that there was intent to commit a crime to prove the case.

### Penalties for Conspiracy to Distribute

Under federal law, the penalty for possession with the intent to distribute is dictated by the Federal Sentencing Guidelines. Once convicted, a second hearing for sentencing is held. The federal judge determines the sentence, and will follow guidelines accordingly. The consequences in terms of fines and length of imprisonment vary widely depending upon the controlled substance and whether the person convicted has a prior history of crime.
