[Punishment for grand theft](http://sevenslegal.com/) includes prison time, restitution to the victim and the law enforcement agency, reimbursement for supervision costs, counseling, high court fines, and/or probation or parole.

Theft is the unlawful taking of somebody else’s property without their permission.

California Penal Code Section 487 PC covers grand theft while California Penal Code Sections 484 and 488 both cover petty theft.

### Penal Code Section 484 – Petty Theft Violation

Penal Code Section 484 covers [general theft crime violations](http://sevenslegal.com/) which has many different degrees of theft. Violating this code is a criminal offense which includes extensive fees, probation, and jail time.

The prosecutor must also prove the intent of the defendant was to permanently deprive the owner of the stolen property.

### Penal Code Section 488 – Petty Theft Misdemeanor

Under Penal Code 488 petty theft involves the[theft of property](http://sevenslegal.com/) with a value of less than $950 and is charged as either an infraction or misdemeanor.

### Legal Process for Theft

Whenever somebody is accused of a crime, whether it’s fraud or theft, they have to go through a legal process involving court. The process involves various outcomes which can result in a court trial to determine whether you are guilty or innocent. Before a trial occurs, if it occurs, certain steps must be gone through.

### General Process for Theft

Following is a general process courts follow, although some courts may have different names for the steps. Unless your criminal attorney advises you otherwise, you should be present for all these steps.

1\. Arraignment. An arraignment is when you formally appear before a judge and told the charges filed against you. During the arraignment you’re asked to enter your plea of guilty, not guilty, or no contest. You can change your plea later.

During the arraignment, the judge outlines any conditions you have to follow to avoid being taken into custody. In order to avoid being taken to jail, you may be required to post a bail or bond until your case is resolved. You have the option to object to any of the conditions the judge sets forth. Its best to have the assistance of a criminal attorney to guide you during this process.

This is where you’ll also get notices of future hearings, including dates for a pre-trial hearing and actual trial.

2\. Pre-trial. Pre-trial hearings let the court monitor the case’s progress. During a pre-trial you and the court can resolve any issues that come up while your case is pending. Frequently at this step a case can be “continued” to permit both parties sufficient time to prepare their cases.

3\. Motions. Depending on your case type and what determinations the court has already made, various legal motions are able to be brought before the court at this time.

4\. Readiness. The “readiness hearing” is when both parties let the court know their “readiness” for trial. This step is scheduled anywhere from several days to several weeks before the beginning of trial. During this step your case can be either continued or resolved.

5\. Trial. Although most cases are resolved beforehand, if your case goes to trial you can decide whether you want a trail by jury, where a jury decides your case, or a bench trial, where a judge will decide your case.
