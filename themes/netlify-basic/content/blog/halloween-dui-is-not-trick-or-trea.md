## Halloween DUI is Not Trick or Trea

CHP Press Release About Halloween and DUI

Recently the California Highway Patrol released a press release to remind us of the following:

> Halloween is often recognized as a holiday that offers just as much fun for adults as it does for children. Youngsters may look forward to a night of trick-or-treating, but many adults choose to partake in the festivities, too – oftentimes with alcohol included. While Halloween may be a spooky night, the California Office of Traffic Safety (OTS) and California Highway Patrol (CHP) want to help ensure that it is also a safe one. If you plan on making alcohol a part of your celebrations this year, designating a sober driver or finding a safe ride home should be a top priority. “Driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs always presents serious, life-threatening risks, but even more so on a night when pedestrians and children are out trick-or-treating,” said OTS Director Rhonda Craft. “By taking just a few extra minutes to designate a sober driver, you will not only avoid the serious risk and costs associated with a DUI, but you will also help protect your own life and the lives of those around you.” According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, between 2009 and 2013, 43 percent of all traffic fatalities on Halloween night involved an impaired driver. In 2013 alone, 26 percent of all pedestrian fatalities on Halloween night involved an impaired driver. “With Halloween falling on a weekend this year, we expect an increase in celebrations,” said CHP Commissioner Joe Farrow. “With a few simple precautions, you should be able to enjoy the fun and get home safely. Drive sober, avoid distractions behind the wheel, and be especially alert around pedestrians.” Whether out trick-or-treating for the night or heading to a party, it is equally important for adults and children to take necessary safety precautions. For those walking door-to-door, consider using light producing or reflective devices to remain visible to cars. Only cross the street at crosswalks or corners and only when it is safe to do so. Costumes should be kept short enough to avoid tripping, and masks should be lifted or removed while on or crossing a street. Drivers need to pay extra attention to pedestrians – especially small children – as they may be unaware of their surroundings and trick-or-treaters can appear out of nowhere. Party hosts need to be ready with non-alcoholic drinks, food, and the responsibility to make sure their guests get home safely.
