With just a small scanner, and in less than a minute, San Diego police are able to determine just what kind of drugs they are looking at. The new tool is aiding officers in determining what they are dealing with without ever having to open a package.

## New Tool Aids Police in Identifying Drugs

Identifying Drugs Has a New Tool for Police

San Diego police have been given a new tool to keep them safe. As dangerous opioids, such as fentanyl, have started to show up in street pills and powders, officers have been increasingly put at risk of accidental exposure.

In the past, officers have tested drugs in the field by scooping out a small amount of the found substance and mixing it with chemicals in their test kit. They would then await a color change and record the results.

Accidental exposure has happened as a result of the fact that these tests use glass capsules, which are able to break, to test the device.

The TruNarc device changes all of that. These high tech devices, which the manufacturer says uses laser light to easily and quickly test for more than 400 substances, including narcotics, stimulants, depressants, hallucinogens and analgesics through plastic or glass, keeps officers safe.

“Although TruNarc is not a silver bullet for everything, many agencies find the tool invaluable,” Bill Kotowski, sales manager for field and safety instruments.

Now that these tools are available to officers in the field, it makes it easier for charges to be brought. In the past, when substances had to be sent to a lab for review, it would delay the process. Now that substances can be identified easily during an arrest, charges can be brought swiftly.

### Addiction to Prescription Drugs

One key aspect for the rising rates of addiction is the widespread availability of prescription drugs. Many doctors and patients alike know that a pill is the easiest and quickest way to take care of symptoms. In turn, patients trust their doctor will legitimately prescribe the pills that will be the answer to their prayers to relieve their painful ailments. The majority of people think that if a doctor prescribes drugs that are then filled by a reputable pharmacist, that they will be safe. Unfortunately, this isn’t always the case, especially if the drugs aren’t used properly.

### DUI of Marijuana

Driving under the influence of marijuana is a crime in California under Vehicle Code 23152(e) VC. It is similar to driving under the influence of alcohol under vehicle code 23152 (a) VC. Unlike with alcohol, however, the law does not specify that any particular amount of THC in the bloodstream automatically establishes impairment. This can make the crime difficult to prove. For you to be found guilty of DUI marijuana, the prosecutor must prove that:

* You drove a motor vehicle
* Under the influence of marijuana
* Because of the marijuana, your mental abilities were so impaired that you were unable to drive with the caution of a sober person, using ordinary care, under similar circumstances.
* The penalties for DUI of marijuana are the same as the California DUI penalties involving alcohol.
