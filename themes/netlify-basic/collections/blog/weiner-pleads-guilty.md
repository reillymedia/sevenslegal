## Weiner Pleads Guilty

Anthony Weiner Has Pleaded Guilty

As[Weiner](http://sevenslegal.com/), 52, made an emotional statement, he also mentioned he has been seeking treatment.

“I accept full responsibility for my conduct. I have a sickness, but I do not have an excuse,” Weiner said. “I entered intensive treatment, found the courage to take a moral inventory of my defects, and began a program of recovery and mental health treatment that I continue to follow every day.”

As part of his plea agreement, Weiner will forfeit his iPhone, surrender his passport, continue his already on-going mental health treatment, and has been barred from having any contact with the minor.

“Today,[former Congressman Anthony Weiner](http://sevenslegal.com/)admitted and pled guilty to sending sexually explicit images and directions to engage in sexual conduct to a girl he knew to be 15 years old,” said acting US Attorney Joon H. Kim of the Southern District of New York. “Weiner’s conduct was not only reprehensible, but a federal crime, one for which he is now convicted and will be sentenced.”

### On Bail Pending Sentencing

According to a press release, Weiner was released on bail pending sentencing. That sentencing date is scheduled for September 8. It has been recommended, and agreed to by Weiner’s counsel that he receive between 21 and 27 months imprisonment. Ultimately it will be up to a judge to decide the final prison terms.

According to Weiner’s statement in court, he was first contacted by the girl in January 2016 and that for the following two months, he “engaged in obscene communications with this teenager, including sharing explicit images and encouraging her to engage in sexually explicit conduct, just as I had done and continued to do with adult women.”

“I knew this was as morally wrong, as it was unlawful,” he said. “This fall, I came to grips for the first time with the depths of my sickness. I had hit bottom.”

Arlo Devlin-Brown, an attorney at Covington & Burling who is representing Weiner, said the disgraced congressman accepted “full responsibility” for his “inappropriate” actions. Allegations that Weiner had been “sexting” an underage girl began appearing last September. In a statement made at the time, Weiner neither confirmed or denied that he had sent the texts.

“I have repeatedly demonstrated terrible judgment about the people I have communicated with online and the things I have sent. I am filled with regret and heartbroken for those I have hurt,” he said.

Weiner was forced to leave Congress in June 2011 when it was revealed that he was exchanging sexually-charged, sometimes explicit, texts with women other than his then wife.

Indecent exposure under Penal Code Section 314(1) is usually charged as a misdemeanor. Under Penal Code Section 314(2) PC if a defendant has a prior conviction the crime of indecent exposure can be charged as a felony. If there is a past history of lewd acts with minors, the defendant can be charged under Penal Code Section 288 PC.

### Statutory Rape Sex Crime

Statutory rape is when a person 18 or over has sexual intercourse with somebody under 18. The age of 18 is the age California has designated as the “statutory age of consent.” When said individual over 18 has intercourse with somebody under 18 it is referred to as “sex with a minor” and has the charge of rape. It is also illegal in California for a minor to have intercourse with another minor, even if there is mutual consent.

### Child Pornography Possession

The possession of child pornography is prohibited by laws at the state and federal level. Child pornography is any material depicting minors under 18 simulating or otherwise engaging in sexual conduct. Any transaction of child pornography is prohibited by Federal law, as well as any Internet child pornography transaction due to its interstate nature. Pornographic images consist of anybody who looks like a minor even if they are not. Pornographic drawings are also subject to First Amendment defenses when criminal charges apply.

### Crime of Sexual Battery

Sexual battery, also referred to as “sexual assault” or rape, consists of certain touching as well as certain forms of physical contact. Under California Penal Code Section 243.4 PC this may be charged as a misdemeanor or felony in California depending on the facts of the case and the criminal history of the defendant.

### Child Molestation Sex Crime

The crime of child molestation is defined as “lewd acts with a child under age 14,” and refers to offensive and indecent acts of a sexual nature. According to California Penal Code 288 it is illegal to engage in lascivious or lewd acts with a child. Charges for this usually involve accusations that a child has been touched, fondled on their genitals, or that other overt acts of molestation has taken place. Even if the touching was done through a child’s clothing and not on bare skin, you can still be charged with lewd acts against a child.

You might also need to take psychological tests, or be asked to provide other evidence. Write down as many details as possible about what you remember.

3\. Study. A criminal defense attorney will be able to guide you through fighting the allegations, but it’s in your best interest to understand the legal process and know your rights.
