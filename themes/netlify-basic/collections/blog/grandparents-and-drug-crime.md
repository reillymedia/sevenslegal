## Grandparents and Drug Crime

Recent studies indicate [drug crime](https://www.sevenslegal.com/ "Sevens Legal, APC"), as well as other criminal behaviors, are on the rise at an alarming rate. While this is not necessarily unusual, the study finds these types of crimes are rising among people over 50.

### Why Grandparents May Turn to Drug Crime

With people living longer and healthier lives, they may need more money to sustain them during their retirement years. With the price of drugs rising, grandparents may decide to sell their unused painkillers, such as OxyContin and Vicodin, for cash. Reports indicate that painkillers can bring in anywhere from $50 to $80 per pill.

The Florida Department of Corrections has reported that the number of elderly prisoners has increased annually by over 1,000. Between 2000 and 2014, the elderly prison population increased from 5,605 to 21,002, which is approximately 9.9% incrase per year. Compared to the growth rate of the general prision population, this rate is over three times higher.

### Other Reasons for Drug Crime

In additional to financial factors driving the increase, other reasons include feelings of isolation, loneliness, depression, anxiety, stress, boredom, and also just “not giving a damn.” Another much sadder reason is that in many cases where an elderly man may have lost their spouse or loved one, jail is preferable to home since it ensures they’ll have three meals a day, every day, as well as the company of others.

### Other Crimes in Addition to Drug Crime

In addition to drug crime being on the rise, shoplifting and drunk driving are also common in the 50+ age group, as well as sexual offenses, distribution and illegal use of drugs, and violent crimes. In the 50+ age group murder has risen by as much as 15% just this past decade. Arrests for drug crimes has tripled as well.
