<p>Methamphetamine (also called meth, crystal, chalk, and ice, among other terms) is an extremely addictive stimulant drug that is chemically similar to amphetamine. It takes the form of a white, odorless, bitter-tasting crystalline powder. Although Methamphetamines are legal when authorized for prescription use, illegal possession, sale or manufacturing of methamphetamines can carry severe penalties. Methamphetamine use has grown in recent year in the state of California, leaving law officers eager to convict individuals for possession of illegal methamphetamines and stop illegal distribution. You may be charged with a misdemeanor or a felony depending on your criminal history. If you are convicted of a misdemeanor possession you may face up to one year in jail, while a felony possession charge can carry a conviction of 16 months, 2 years or 3 years of jail time. Many times if you are charged with having possession of a large quantity of methamphetamines, you may be charged with intent to sell, which will carry stiff penalties. Charges may include, Possession of Methamphetamines, Possession of Methamphetamines for sale and transportation for selling methamphetamines.</p>
<h2>California Proposition 36 (2000) The Substance Abuse and Crime Prevention Act of 2000</h2>
<p>Proposition 36 allows qualifying defendants convicted if non-violent drug possession offenses to receive a probationary sentence instead of being incarcerated. Defendants are required to participate in and complete a licensed or certified community drug treatment program. Compliance with the program in necessary or probation is revoked and you may be required to serve an additional sentence that may include jail time.</p>
<h2>Proposition 47</h2>
<p>On November 4, 2014, voters approved Proposition 47, which among other things, reduced drug possession for personal use to a misdemeanor.</p>
<h2>Meth manufacturing or “Meth Labs”</h2>
<p>A meth lab – or clandestine drug lab – is a place where meth is manufactured or “cooked.” Materials used in a meth lab are commonly used and readily available. Other drugs may be manufactured or&nbsp;processed along with meth. Meth “recipes” can be easily obtained through the internet or by associating with other people who “cook” meth.</p>
<p>These “recipes” can include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Over-the-counter medications that include pseudoephedrine or ephedrine in their contents.</li>
<li>Combinations of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), acids, bases, metals, solvents and salts.</li>
<li>Chemical products and substances that are used interchangeably to produce meth in different forms.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Depending on the process and chemicals used, the final product can be tainted and have unwanted or dangerous effects.</li>
</ul>
<p>Chemical reactions depend on the substances used and cause the process to be hazardous, frequently resulting in&nbsp;<strong>chemical fires, explosions, and the release of toxic gases</strong>.</p>
<p>Meth cooking produces&nbsp;<strong>5 to 7 pounds of solid and liquid chemical wastes for each pound of meth made</strong>. These byproducts are considered hazardous waste, and it can contaminate a building and its contents or the groundwater or soil where they are dumped.</p>
<p>The manufacturing of Meth is extremely dangerous and can lead to a number of bad outcomes.</p>
<p><b>Here are a number of ways you can identify a meth lab:</b></p>
<p>Labs can exist indoors or outdoors, in houses, apartment buildings, motels, vehicles, wooded areas or fields.</p>
<p><strong>Signs of illegal production or sales of drugs, including meth, are:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Frequent visitors</em>at all times of the day or night</li>
<li><em>Occupants appear unemployed</em>, yet make cash purchases or payments</li>
<li><em>Occupants are unfriendly</em>, appear secretive, lie, or display odd or paranoid behavior</li>
<li><em>Covering of windows or other security measures</em>such as signs, fences, cameras</li>
<li><em>Burn pits, stained soil or dead vegetation</em>indicating chemical or waste dumping</li>
<li>Strong chemical odors including ammonia or solvent smells at random times</li>
</ul>
<h2>Methamphetamine Addiction</h2>
<p>The abuse of methamphetamine—a potent and highly addictive stimulant—remains an extremely serious problem in the United States.</p>
<p>The consequences of methamphetamine abuse are terrible for the individual––psychologically, medically, and socially. Abusing the drug can cause memory loss, aggression, psychotic behavior, damage to the cardiovascular system, malnutrition, and severe dental problems.
