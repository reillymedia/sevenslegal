<h2>DUI of Marijuana</h2>
Driving under the influence of marijuana is a crime in California under Vehicle Code 23152(e) VC. It is similar to&nbsp;driving under the influence of alcohol under vehicle code 23152 (a) VC.

Unlike with alcohol, however, the law does not specify that any particular amount of THC in the bloodstream automatically establishes impairment. This can make the crime difficult to prove.

For you to be found guilty of DUI marijuana, the prosecutor must prove that:
<ul>
	<li>You drove a motor vehicle</li>
	<li>Under the influence of marijuana</li>
	<li>Because of the marijuana, your mental abilities were so impaired that you were unable to drive with the caution of a sober person, using ordinary care, under similar circumstances.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>The penalties for DUI of marijuana are the same as the&nbsp;California DUI penalties&nbsp;involving alcohol.</li>
</ul>
