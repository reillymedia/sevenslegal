### Defenses for Assault and Battery

A common defense in [assault and battery](https://www.sevenslegal.com/san-diego-assault-battery-lawyer/ "San Diego Assault and Battery Lawyer") cases is self-defense, but others that can also be used include:

*   Insufficient evidence – If there was nobody to witness the alleged assault and battery, and there are no injuries visible on the victim, a judge may dismiss the charges of assault and battery based on insufficient evidence.
*   No intent - Similar to insufficient evidence, the prosecution must prove there was an intent on your part to harm another person. If you caused harm to another person by accidentally hitting them, there was no premeditated intent on your part to cause them harm.
*   Defense of others and/or property – Everybody has the right to legally defend themselves, loved ones, and property, by reasonable force.
*   Drug and/or alcohol intoxication – If you willing take drugs or drink alcohol, you can still be blamed for the way you behaved while on these substances. Saying you were "too smashed" to know what you were doing is not a valid defense.
*   Consent – Assault and battery charges assume there was no consent on the part of the victim to being touched. If the victim voluntarily entered a situation where they could be harmed, charges may be dropped since they willingly put themselves in harm's way. An example would be assault and/or battery when playing sports.
*   Insanity – Insanity can be used, although it can be a "tough sell" and may result in your being committed to a mental institution.
