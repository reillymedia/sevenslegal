You hear the word "[indictment](https://www.sevenslegal.com/ "Sevens Legal, APC")" in the news and on shows about attorneys, but what does it mean, especially for a person who has been [indicted](https://www.sevenslegal.com/ "Sevens Legal, APC")?

Definition of "Indictment"
--------------------------

An [indictment](https://www.sevenslegal.com/ "Sevens Legal, APC") is when a person is formally accused and charged with committing a crime.

While there are other ways a person can be accused of committing a crime, an indictment is used in the United States to formally accuse a person, especially in cases of federal crimes. The Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution states that a person can only be charged with a capital, or other infamous crime, by being [indicted by a grand jury](https://www.sevenslegal.com/ "Sevens Legal, APC"). Because this amendment does not extend to state courts, it's isn't used as often in the state court system.

### What Happens When You're Indicted?

Usually when a grand jury hands down an [indictment](https://www.sevenslegal.com/ "Sevens Legal, APC") the defendant is then [arraigned](https://www.sevenslegal.com/ "Sevens Legal, APC"). When a defendant is [arraigned](https://www.sevenslegal.com/ "Sevens Legal, APC"), the first step in a trial, an initial plea of guilty, not guilty, or no contest, is made in court. Unlike the actual trial, it's used to enter the plea, decide if the defendant needs or already has representation, and if necessary sets their bail. After a [defendant is arraigned](https://www.sevenslegal.com/ "Sevens Legal, APC") they go to trial with either a jury or a judge.

If you have been [indicted for a crime](https://www.sevenslegal.com/ "Sevens Legal, APC"), you need the expert assistance of a criminal defense attorney such as Sevens Legal, APC, to assist in the court process and all legal proceedings related to your case.
