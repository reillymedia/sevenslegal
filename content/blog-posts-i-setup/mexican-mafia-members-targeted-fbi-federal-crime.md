On December 10, 2014, East Los Angeles homes were raided by law enforcement officers searching for 38 [gang members](https://www.sevenslegal.com/ "Sevens Legal, APC") allegedly tied to the Big Hazard gang and Mexican Mafia. Individuals were arrested for federal racketeering for crimes ranging from theft to drug dealing and murder.

### 28 Federal Crime Arrests

The raid was led jointly by Los Angeles police enforcement and the FBI. FBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller stated that 28 of the 38 people named that were targeted were arrested. Of the remaining ten, seven had already been arrested and one was killed over the weekend in a shooting currently under investigation.

### Federal Crime Charges

A news conference was held by the U.S. attorney's office about the charges and investigation into the gang. In addition to those arrested, 4 other named co-conspirators who are allegedly members of the Big Hazard gang and are "made members" of the Mexican Mafia, are currently serving life sentences. These 4 members are able to issue orders from prison.

The indictment states the Mexican Mafia controls crimes and drug dealing by Latino gangs outside as well as inside prison. The alleged gang members deal heroin, methamphetamines, crack cocaine, sell guns, and collect "taxes" from other drug dealers.

The Big Hazard gang, started in the 1940's, got it's name from nearby Hazard Park, and has approximately 350 members. Its headquarters is in the Ramona Gardens housing project.
