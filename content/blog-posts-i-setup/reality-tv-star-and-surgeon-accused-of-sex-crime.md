A Former Bravo reality TV star and his girlfriend have been charged with multiple counts of aÂ sex crime. The women who have stepped forward so far allege the attractive couple got them drunk and lured them back to the surgeon's apartment before making sexual advances.

Reality Star Robicheaux and Surgeon Riley Accused of Sex Crime
--------------------------------------------------------------

California orthopedic surgeon Grant William Robicheaux, 38, appeared on the Bravo television show "Online Dating Rituals of the American Male" four years ago. He is now facing claims that he sexually assaulted numerous women with the help of his girlfriend, 31-year-old Cerissa Laura Riley.

Multiple women, from Southern California, Nevada, and New York, have stepped forward to accuse the couple. District Attorney Tony Rackauckas fears there may be more victims, adding that the couple videotaped hundreds -- if not thousands -- of sexual encounters with women.

### Accusations

The first victim, 32, alleges she met the couple at a Newport Beach restaurant in April 2016, where they brought the woman back to the apartment "once she was intoxicated."

"The defendants are accused of supplying multiple drugs to the victim, then raping and orally copulating her while she was prevented from resisting due to intoxicating and controlled substances and they should have reasonably known of her condition," according to the district attorney's office.

The woman contacted police the day after.

The second case happened six months later, in October 2016.

The couple met the second victim at a Newport Beach bar, where they drank with her until she was unconscious.

Prosecutors allege the couple took the victim to Robicheaux's apartment, where they sexually assaulted her "with intent to commit rape." According to officials, the woman was able to scream for help which prompted a neighbor to contact police.

### More Victims

"We believe the defendants used their good looks and charms to lower the inhibitions of their potential prey," Rackauckas said. "We've all heard of a wolf in sheep's clothing. Well, a wolf can wear scrubs or doctor's clothing. Or a wolf can be a beautiful woman."

### Charges

Robicheaux and Riley have been charged with rape by use of drugs, oral copulation by anesthesia or controlled substance, and assault with intent to commit sexual offense, possession of a controlled substance for sale, and Robicheaux faces an additional charge of possessing an assault weapon.

If found guilty, Robicheaux could serve up to 40 years in prison, while Riley faces just over 30 years.

They are due back in court on Oct. 25.

### What is "Sexual Assault"

Sexual assault is defined as any type of sexual contact or behavior that occurs without the explicit consent of a recipient. Included under the term sexual assault are the following: forced sexual intercourse, forcible sodomy, child molestation, incest, fondling, and attempted rape.

### What is Rape? Penal Code Section 261 PC

When they hear the term rape, many people create a mental image of an assault committed by means of violent physical force. The reality is, however, that rape is any non-consensual sexual activity, including those accomplished without physical means, using such methods as drugs or guile. Any form of sexual conduct forced on a person against their will through means of violence, menace, duress, fear of injury, or other danger is rape under California law.

There are a number of statutes in California that pertain to rape, all of which are among the most serious of criminal offenses with which an individual can be charged.

The most common type of rape (Penal Code Section 261 PC) is defined as criminal offense that involves nonconsensual sexual intercourse by means of threats, force, or fraud. At its core, this form of rape involves vaginal or anal penetration that includes force by instrumentation on someone, conscious or unconscious, or on any victim unable to consent.

### Date Rape

Date rape charges are also filed under Penal Code Section 261 PC. Cases of this nature can sometimes be highly contested between the victim and the accused with the difference between a conviction and an acquittal depending on who the jury believes. The question of if sex took place is often not questioned, but rather was the sex consensual or not? Most of these cases do not involve force or injury to the victim. Often, they are cases of "he said, she said" with the defendant having the greatest stake in the outcome.

### Other Forms of Rape:

*   Penal Code 262 PC "Spousal Rape."
*   Penal Code 261.5 PC "Statutory Rape."

Other forms of rape warrant their own specific statutes in state law. Examples include:

*   Penal Code 262 PC "Spousal Rape." Anyone who has intercourse with their spouse without their consent and does so with force or threat, and for sexual pleasure or arousal, is guilty of violating California Penal Code 262.
*   Penal Code 261.5 PC "Statutory Rape." Anyone who knowingly has intercourse with a minor can be found guilty of Statutory Rape. A minor is defined as anyone under the age of 18.

### Penalties for Rape

Rape is one of the most serious criminal charges that a defendant may face. A case may be highly complex because of circumstances that are difficult to explain and understand. The penalties for these offenses are harsh and conviction includes lifetime sex offender registration.

### Addressing False Rape Accusations

Sexual assault crimes are taken very seriously by the law. If you have been falsely accused you might assume that the charges will just be dropped because of how ludicrous they are to you. But take this case for example - and the wide-reaching effects that it had on just members of the fraternity associated with the rape allegations. These types of allegations do not just "go away," and you will need to be prepared if you are falsely accused.

Here are some things you can do:

1.  Do not speak with police or investigators until you have contacted a criminal defense attorney. They might try different tactics to get you to admit to a crime you did not commit. Remember that they are always trying to build a case. Simply state that you will not speak with them unless there is an attorney present.
2.  Get in touch with a qualified and experienced criminal defense attorney. You'll want to do this as soon as possible, even if you just expect the charges to be dismissed.
3.  Prepare for what the allegations might bring. You will be asked to defend yourself, so you'll need to be prepared. This means contacting witnesses that can testify or provide an alibi for you. You might also need to take psychological tests, or be asked to provide other evidence. Write down as many details as possible about what you remember.
4.  Study. A criminal defense attorney will be able to guide you through fighting the allegations, but it's in your best interest to understand the legal process and know your rights.

You will want to follow all the legal rules and precautions you can, and the best way you can protect yourself is by working with an experienced defense attorney such as Sevens Legal, APC.

### If You Get Arrested for a Sex Crime

In 1966, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Miranda v. Arizona, that individuals arrested because they are believed to have committed a crime are allowed certain rights that must be explained to them. This must happen before any interrogation. It's important to note that these rights only need to be read when a person has been taken into custody. "Miranda Rights" are meant to protect a suspect from self-incrimination and is protected under the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Those "Miranda Rights" are as follows:

*   You have the right to remain silent and refuse to answer questions.
*   Anything you say may be used against you in a court of law.
*   You have the right to consult an attorney before speaking to the police and to have an attorney present during questioning now or in the future.
*   If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed for you before any questioning if you wish.
*   If you decide to answer questions now without an attorney present, you will still have the right to stop answering at any time until you talk to an attorney. Knowing and understanding your rights as I have explained them to you, are you willing to answer my questions without an attorney present?
