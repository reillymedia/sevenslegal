Any crime that a person under 18 commits falls under the category of [juvenile crimes](https://www.sevenslegal.com/san-diego-juvenile-crime-lawyer/ "San Diego Juvenile Crime Lawyer"). Here are some of the things to expect at a trial if your child is accused of a juvenile crime.

Juvenile Court Referral for Juvenile Crimes
-------------------------------------------

Once your child's case has been referred to juvenile court by a police officer, a [juvenile court](https://www.sevenslegal.com/san-diego-juvenile-crime-lawyer/ "San Diego Juvenile Crime Lawyer") intake officer or prosecutor takes control of it. The prosecutor or intake officer can either dismiss the case, informally handle it, or file formal charges which means "petition the case." To determine the best way to proceed, the following variables will be taken into consideration:

*   the severity of the crime
*   the child's age
*   any previous record the child may have
*   the strength of the evidence against the child
*   the child's gender (boys tend to be charged more than girls)
*   social history of the child, and
*   ability of the parents to control their child's behavior

If parental neglect or abuse is suspected, the judge of the [juvenile court](https://www.sevenslegal.com/san-diego-juvenile-crime-lawyer/ "San Diego Juvenile Crime Lawyer") may decide to begin proceedings that will remove the child from the custody of their parent or guardian.

An average of 20% of all cases referred to [juvenile court](https://www.sevenslegal.com/san-diego-juvenile-crime-lawyer/ "San Diego Juvenile Crime Lawyer") are dismissed by the prosecutor or intake officer, 25% are informally handled, and the remaining 55% are formally charged.

### The Process for Informal Proceedings for Juvenile Crimes

In an informal proceeding, the child appears before a judge or probation officer. Although the child receives no formal charges, they will still face certain types of penalties during the informal proceedings, such as:

*   receiving a stern lecture
*   must attendance counseling
*   must attend classes after school
*   must repay any damages to their victim
*   must pay a fine
*   must perform community service, or
*   must enter probation
