A jury has found [Bill Cosby](https://www.sevenslegal.com/assault/retrial-bill-cosby-begins/798/) guilty of three counts of aggravated indecent assault for drugging and [sexually assaulting](https://www.sevenslegal.com/san-diego-sex-crimes-lawyer/) Andrea Constand at his home in a Philadelphia suburb in 2004.

Jury Finds Bill Cosby Guilty
----------------------------

Now that the 80-year-old comedian has been convicted, he faces up to 10 years in prison on each count. Cosby is likely to serve them concurrently. Cosby is currently out on bail and a sentencing hearing with Judge Steven O'Neill has not yet been scheduled.

Cosby did not testify in court and remained quiet through the proceedings and while the conviction was read. Yet, shortly after prosecutors asked the judge to revoke Cosby's bail, on grounds that he is a flight risk and has a private plane, the comedian stood up and yelled: "He doesn't have a plane, you asshole."

Judge O'Neill ruled [Cosby](https://www.sevenslegal.com/assault/retrial-bill-cosby-begins/798/) should not leave his home. Cosby has homes in multiple states, and the judge noted if he fails to arrange with the appropriate offices to stay in a home in another state, he must first be fitted with a GPS tracking device.

Last year Cosby's case ended in mistrial after jurors were unable to unanimously agree on a verdict. Prosecutors immediately announced after that mistrial that they would re-try the comedian. This jury deliberated for more than 14 hours over two days to reach the verdict.

A huge win for the prosecution came when five other Cosby accusers were allowed to testify as "prior bad acts" witnesses. Each of them said Cosby had drugged and assaulted them decades ago.

This was the first celebrity sexual assault trial since the #MeToo movement gained momentum last fall. Many feel this verdict is demonstrative of a cultural shift in how sexual misconduct allegations are handled.

"What was revealed through this investigation was a man who had spent decades preying on women that he drugged and sexually assaulted, and a man who evaded this moment right here far too long," Montgomery County District Attorney Kevin Steele said. "He used his celebrity, he used his wealth, he used his network of supporters to help him conceal his crimes."

Cosby's attorney, Tom Mesereau, said he plans to appeal "very strongly."

"We are very disappointed by the verdict. We don't think Mr. Cosby's guilty of anything and the fight is not over," he said.

### What is "Sexual Assault"

Sexual assault is defined as any type of sexual contact or behavior that occurs without the explicit consent of a recipient. Included under the term sexual assault are the following: forced sexual intercourse, forcible sodomy, child molestation, incest, fondling, and attempted rape.

### Addressing Sexual Assault Accusations

Sexual assault crimes are taken very seriously by the law. If you have been falsely accused you might assume that the charges will just be dropped because of how ludicrous they are to you. These types of allegations do not just "go away," and you will need to be prepared if you are falsely accused.

Here are some things you can do:

1\. Do not speak with police or investigators until you have contacted a criminal defense attorney. They might try different tactics to get you to admit to a crime you did not commit. Remember that they are always trying to build a case. Simply state that you will not speak with them unless there is an attorney present.

2\. Get in touch with a qualified and experienced criminal defense attorney. You'll want to do this as soon as possible, even if you just expect the charges to be dismissed. Prepare for what the allegations might bring. You will be asked to defend yourself, so you'll need to be prepared. This means contacting witnesses that can testify or provide an alibi for you. You might also need to take psychological tests, or be asked to provide other evidence. Write down as many details as possible about what you remember.

3\. Study. A criminal defense attorney will be able to guide you through fighting the allegations, but it's in your best interest to understand the legal process and know your rights.

You will want to follow all the legal rules and precautions you can, and the best way you can protect yourself is by working with an experienced defense attorney such as Sevens Legal, APC.

### If You Get Arrested for a Sex Crime

In 1966, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Miranda v. Arizona, that individuals arrested because they are believed to have committed a crime are allowed certain rights that must be explained to them. This must happen before any interrogation. It's important to note that these rights only need to be read when a person has been taken into custody. "Miranda Rights" are meant to protect a suspect from self-incrimination and is protected under the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Those "Miranda Rights" are as follows:

*   You have the right to remain silent and refuse to answer questions.
*   Anything you say may be used against you in a court of law.
*   You have the right to consult an attorney before speaking to the police and to have an attorney present during questioning now or in the future.
*   If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed for you before any questioning if you wish.
*   If you decide to answer questions now without an attorney present, you will still have the right to stop answering at any time until you talk to an attorney. Knowing and understanding your rights as I have explained them to you, are you willing to answer my questions without an attorney present?
