### Assault, Assault and Battery, or Aggravated Assault

The terms get thrown around a lot, but it's important to understand the difference between assault, assault and battery, or v. While they all involve one person doing intentional harm to another person, crimes involving physical attacks can be assaults or batteries or both. Depending on the seriousness of the attack, charges can be elevated to the most serious one of aggravated assault.

### "Assault"

Assault is defined as the intentional act of causing another person to be afraid they are going to experience physical harm. While this is a broad definition, since actual physical harm doesn't have to be involved, assault is the fact that a person fears imminent harm from another person. The broadness of this definition permits the police to intervene to prevent any actual harm to the person.

### "Simple" and "Aggravated Assault"

Depending on the seriousness of the potential harm that may occur to a victim, many states make a distinction between "simple" and "[aggravated assault](https://www.sevenslegal.com/)." Aggravated assault is a felony which may involve an assault with a weapon, or the intention to commit a serious crime. It can also be classified as aggravated assault if there is any legally regarded "special protection" relationship involved. If the assault is classified as simple assault its usually charged as a misdemeanor. In some states the seriousness of the assault may be classified as "first," "second," or "third" degree assaults, in which case a "first" degree assault is the most serious one.

### Assault with a Deadly Weapon

An assault with a deadly weapon is when a person accompanies a physical attack with a physical object that capable of inflicting serious bodily injury or death. All states classify assault with a deadly weapon as a felony because the use of a dangerous object automatically creates a risk of serious consequences.

### Deadly Weapon

The term "deadly weapon" typically refers to a wide range of objects capable of inflicting bodily harm. Examples include cars, golf clubs, knives, and guns. Other things such as pocketknives, stones, shoes, canes, and walking sticks can become "deadly weapons" depending on how a person wields them.

### Penalties for Assault in California

A defendant convicted of simple assault faces the following possible penalties:

*   up to one year in jail
*   a fine up to $2000, and
*   probation up to one year

(Cal. Penal Code § 241, 241.5, 241.6).

### "Assault and Battery"

Assault and battery were originally considered to be separate crimes. While assault is the fear of impending physical harm, battery is defined as the actual physical harm done to a victim. While "assault" can be considered the beginning, "battery" can be consider the ending. Most statutes now do not make a distinction between these two offenses.

### Penalties for Battery in California

Basic penalties for simple battery that are charged as a misdemeanor include:

*   up to one year in county jail
*   fine up to $2000, and
*   probation up to one year.

(Cal. Penal Code §§ 243, 243.2, 243.25, 243.3, 243.35, 243.6, 243.65, 243.8).

### San Diego Aggravated Assault Lawyer

Certain assaults are considered aggravated assault when a person causes serious bodily injury purposely, knowingly, or recklessly under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life. Assault with a deadly weapon, commonly referred to as ADW, is an aggravated assault because it is committed with any type of deadly weapon or by means of force that is likely to cause great bodily injury to another. ADW is a "wobbler," meaning that, depending on the circumstances, prosecutors can charge it as either a misdemeanor or a felony.

### California State Law

State battery law prohibits the willful and unlawful use of force or violence against anybody. The Penal Code includes specific code sections regarding battery against specified persons such as peace officers, police officers, fire fighters, emergency response technicians, school employees, and others. The Penal Code also establishes separate laws regarding battery in the context of domestic violence.
