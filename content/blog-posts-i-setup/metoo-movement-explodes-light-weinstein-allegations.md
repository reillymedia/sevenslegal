This past week, following the allegations of sexual misconduct by Harvey Weinstein, a new kind of movement emerged: The "#MeToo" Movement.

Weinstein Allegations Make #MeToo Movement Explode
--------------------------------------------------

Social media feeds like Facebook and Twitter have been filled with the #MeToo hashtag. The hashtag serves as a way of survivors to share their own personal stories of sexual abuse. From celebrities like Alyssa Milano to political figures like Senator Elizabeth Warren, millions of women have posted the hashtag as a way of acknowledging that they have been the victim of sexual misconduct. "It is a watershed moment for survivors and allies," Lisa Huebner, an associate professor of women's and gender studies at West Chester University of Pennsylvania.

### More Come Forward

Since last week, even more women have joined the list of Weinstein accusers. On Oct.10 actresses Gwyneth Paltrow and Angelina Jolie also stepped forward to say they been harassed by Mr. Weinstein.

Weinstein has also been ousted from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and police in New York and London are investigation some of the accusations.

What is clear is that we will most likely hear more about Weinstein in the coming months and definitely more from the #MeToo movement.

### What is "Sexual Assault"

Sexual assault is defined as any type of sexual contact or behavior that occurs without the explicit consent of a recipient. Included under the term sexual assault are the following: forced sexual intercourse, forcible sodomy, child molestation, incest, fondling, and attempted rape.

### Addressing Sexual Assault Accusations

Sexual assault crimes are taken very seriously by the law. If you have been falsely accused you might assume that the charges will just be dropped because of how ludicrous they are to you. These types of allegations do not just "go away," and you will need to be prepared if you are falsely accused.

Here are some things you can do:

1\. Do not speak with police or investigators until you have contacted a criminal defense attorney. They might try different tactics to get you to admit to a crime you did not commit. Remember that they are always trying to build a case. Simply state that you will not speak with them unless there is an attorney present.

2\. Get in touch with a qualified and experienced criminal defense attorney. You'll want to do this as soon as possible, even if you just expect the charges to be dismissed. Prepare for what the allegations might bring. You will be asked to defend yourself, so you'll need to be prepared. This means contacting witnesses that can testify or provide an alibi for you. You might also need to take psychological tests, or be asked to provide other evidence. Write down as many details as possible about what you remember.

3\. Study. A criminal defense attorney will be able to guide you through fighting the allegations, but it's in your best interest to understand the legal process and know your rights.

You will want to follow all the legal rules and precautions you can, and the best way you can protect yourself is by working with an experienced defense attorney such as Sevens Legal, APC.

### If You Get Arrested for a Sex Crime

In 1966, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Miranda v. Arizona, that individuals arrested because they are believed to have committed a crime are allowed certain rights that must be explained to them. This must happen before any interrogation. It's important to note that these rights only need to be read when a person has been taken into custody. "Miranda Rights" are meant to protect a suspect from self-incrimination and is protected under the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Those "Miranda Rights" are as follows:

*   You have the right to remain silent and refuse to answer questions.
*   Anything you say may be used against you in a court of law.
*   You have the right to consult an attorney before speaking to the police and to have an attorney present during questioning now or in the future.
*   If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed for you before any questioning if you wish.
*   If you decide to answer questions now without an attorney present, you will still have the right to stop answering at any time until you talk to an attorney. Knowing and understanding your rights as I have explained them to you, are you willing to answer my questions without an attorney present?

### Why Work with a Criminal Defense Lawyer?

When faced with serious penalties or spending time in jail or prison, you need to retain a criminal defense lawyer to represent you in court.

They also will be able to identify if there are any other existing reasons for why the case should be dismissed before it goes to trial.
