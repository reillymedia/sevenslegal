To ensure a defendant shows up in court and obeys any conditions related to their release before their trial date, the court sets a [bail amount](https://www.sevenslegal.com/ "Sevens Legal, APC"). Once the court case has concluded, whether the decision was guilty or innocent, the bail isn't needed anymore and the court releases it.

Definition of Bail
------------------

The court may set a [bail amount](https://www.sevenslegal.com/ "Sevens Legal, APC") to ensure the defendant appears in court for their trial. Paying it permits the person to remain out of jail during the trial process.

When arrested and charged with a crime, they don't immediately go to trial. Depending on how serious the allegations are, any prior record, and whether they are a flight risk, a [bail amount](https://www.sevenslegal.com/ "Sevens Legal, APC") is determined to make sure the defendant appears in court for their trial. If bail is not able to be paid, the defendant remains in custody until their trial is concluded. The bail is exonerated, or released, by the court when the trial is over, irregardless of the verdict.

### How Bail is Returned

After the defendant posts the amount for [bail amount](https://www.sevenslegal.com/ "Sevens Legal, APC") and shows up for the duration of their court trial, the full amount of bail is returned to them, whether they were found guilty or innocent.

### Bail Forfeited if Court Date is Missed

If bail is posted by the defendant, but then they fail to appear in court for their trial, they forfeit the bail and its kept by the court. If the defendant later returns to court, their attorney can request the court to reinstate the bail. Depending on the reason as to why the defendant missed their court date, the bail may or may not be reinstated.
