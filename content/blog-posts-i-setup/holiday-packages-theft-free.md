Theft of Holiday Packages
-------------------------

Police report that cross the country the [package theft](https://www.sevenslegal.com/ "Sevens Legal, APC") has increased. Even if thieves are caught in the act on video cameras, they still get escape arrest. CyberMonday this year was the biggest since 2010, meaning more packages will be delivered to porches, easy picking for thieves. Although statistics are not available, UPS spokesman Andy McGowan has stated "a very small number" of packages are stolen.

### Protecting Against Package Theft

### Shipping to Local Mail Facility

Major mail carriers let you re-route your packages to a local mail office. UPS spokesman McGowan notes,"These centers can serve as a 'mailroom receiving agent' and offer a real street address, secure 24-hour access (at participating locations) and email or text notification when you have a package waiting." For FedEx this is free, but both UPS and USPS charge a fee. UPS also accepts packages from other carriers.

### Trusted Neighbor or Friend

If you're not going to be home to when a package is scheduled to be delivered, you may be able to ask a neighbor or friend to wait for your package for you. According to Sheriff Anthony Wickersham of Michigan's Macomb County, "Neighbors protect neighbors by flagging suspicious activity to each other and the police."
