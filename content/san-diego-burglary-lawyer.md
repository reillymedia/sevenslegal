What is Burglary?
-----------------

Burglary, often referred to as “breaking and entering”, is the crime of breaking and entering into a structure for the purpose of committing another crime. The entry must be unauthorized but does not need to include the use of force. While burglary is often associated with theft, any unlawful entry for the purpose of committing any crime, such as theft or assault, constitutes burglary.

Under California Penal code 459, you can be found guilty of burglary in California for entering a building, vehicle, vessel or cargo container (structure) with the intention of either stealing something or committing a felony.

What are the Penalties for Burglary?
------------------------------------

*   Imprisonment
*   Probation
*   Fines
*   Other consequences of a felony conviction

First Degree Burglary
---------------------

Burglary of a house, apartment, hotel room (or other structure where people are living) is always a felony in the state of California. It is known as “First Degree Burglary” or “Residential Burglary”.

Sentencing for First Degree (Residential) Burglary:

*   Two (2), four (4), or six (6) years in State Prison

Second Degree Burglary
----------------------

Burglary at a store, business (or any other place where people are not residing) is considered “Second Degree Burglary” in the state of California. It is also referred to as “Commercial burglary”.

The criminal statues on the books in each state provide their own specific definitions of what constitutes burglary. What distinguished the burglary from less misdemeanors such as trespassing is that, with burglary, the prosecution has to prove that a defendant intended to commit a felony (not necessarily involving stealing) or a theft inside a building, at the very moment the defendant entered.

Prosecutors may elect to file a “Commercial Burglary” charge as a misdemeanor or a felony based on an individuals circumstances and criminal history.

**Sentencing for Second Degree (Commercial) Burglary**

*   16 months, two (2), three (3) years in a state prison
*   Up to 10,000 in fines

Second Degree as a misdemeanor
