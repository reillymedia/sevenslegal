A common misconception about domestic violence is that it only involves women. Domestic violence refers to any dispute between husbands and wives, fathers and sons and/or daughters, mothers and sons and/or daughters, same-sex couples, and co-habitating couples. Domestic violence has psychological and emotional scars that last long after the physical ones. Domestic Violence is a “violent confrontation that occurs between family members or between people who live together or are in a dating relationship."
