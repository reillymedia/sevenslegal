--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The abuse of alcohol and/or drugs has the ability to impair your judgment when ingested at certain rates and volumes. Driving an automobile or operating machinery of any kind while under the influence is incredibly dangerous, not only to the driver but to other people who may cross his or her path. Every year, countless unnecessary deaths occur as a result of collisions with drivers whose judgment was impaired by alcohol consumption. If you are suspected of driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, under the laws of the state of California, an officer can legally require you to take a breathalyzer, blood or urine test. It is within your rights to refuse such testing, yet if you are found guilty, driver license suspension and revocation will be extended. Knowing your rights is essential, and aligning yourself with a skilled and successful DUI/DWI attorney will be to your benefit. The attorneys at Sevens Legal, APC of San Diego draw on over 40 years of combined expertise in the field of criminal defense and will aggressively represent your DUI/DWI case in court.

Operating a Vehicle While Impaired
----------------------------------

When operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol, one’s hearing and vision may be significantly impaired as well as the speed at which he or she is able to respond to driving conditions and hazardous situations. Consuming alcohol while operating a vehicle is strictly forbidden, and any container of alcohol within the vehicle must remain sealed or detained safely in the trunk.

In the state of California, it is illegal to operate a vehicle with a Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC) of:

*   08% or higher, if the person is age 21 or older.
*   01% or higher, if the person is under age 21.
*   01% or higher at any age, if the person is on Driving Under the Influence (DUI) probation.
*   04% or higher, in any vehicle requiring a commercial driver license (CDL)—with or without a CDL issued to the driver.

Arrested for a DUI?
-------------------

If you are arrested for a DUI/DWI the Department of Motor Vehicle (DMV) has the right to remove or alter your driving privileges following your detention or arrest. The DMV has jurisdiction over your driving privileges, while the court administers fines, penalties and punishments such as incarceration, probation, driver license suspension, automobile impoundment, treatment programs and community service.

Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC) of 0.08% or more. Stricter BAC regulations apply to commercial vehicle drivers (0.04%) and any driver under the age of 21 (0.01%). Don’t gamble with your safety or the safety of others, and don’t take chances with your freedom and your record. Losing your license as a result of a DUI/DWI can cause immense challenges in your ability to commute to work and perform essential daily and routine tasks.
