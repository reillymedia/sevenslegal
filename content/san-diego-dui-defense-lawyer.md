The city of San Diego and it’s surrounding county has many areas to enjoy an excellent night out, whether you’re downtown club-hopping, catching a Padres game or enjoying a glass of wine while watching the sunset on the coast. Despite how conducive San Diego is to having a good time while enjoying drinks with friends, drinking and driving carries strict, harsh penalties in the state of California, with little to no sympathy for offenders. If you or someone you love is facing a DUI/DWI (Driving Under the Influence or Driving While Intoxicated) charge, you’ll want the best San Diego has to offer in criminal defense on your side. Driving while under the influence of alcohol is immensely dangerous, and you don’t want the injury or death of an innocent victim on your record or your conscience.

Laws surrounding drinking and driving and blood alcohol concentration (BAC) may vary depending on state, and California has developed a no-tolerance policy towards DUI offenders. In 1990, the 0.08% blood alcohol concentration (BAC) limit was established in the state of California and still stands 24 years later. According to the California Department of Motor Vehicles, it is illegal for any person to operate a vehicle with a:  

*   BACof 0.08% or higher, if the person is age 21 or older.
*   BACof 0.01% or higher, if the person is under age 21.
*   BACof 0.01% or higher at any age, if the person is on Driving Under the Influence (DUI) probation.
*   BACof 0.04% or higher, in any vehicle requiring a commercial driver license (CDL)—with or without a CDL issued to the driver.

  Besides the crippling cost of DUI/DWI penalties, the suspension or revoking of one’s license can cause immense challenges, especially when a suspension directly impacts the financial wellbeing of your family and your economic livelihood. The skilled attorneys at Sevens Legal can help maintain your license or adjust permissions to allow the continuation of commuting to an essential workplace.
