San Diego Marijuana Lawyer
--------------------------

California is one of two-dozen states that have legalized marijuana for medical use. Recreational use of marijuana is still illegal in the state of California and possessing marijuana or intent to sell marijuana can carry heavy convictions. Although sentencing for marijuana has been pulled back in recent years, one ounce of marijuana or 28.5 grams is an infraction; police often get around this provision by charging minor offenders with felony intent to sell. You may find yourself being charged with intent to sell if you have cash, scales, and large amounts of marijuana or marijuana in bags on your persons. Due to proposition 36 and other legislation, if you are convicted of a misdemeanor marijuana charge you may find yourself paying a small fine. Charges are often reduced or dropped for first time offenders with the help of a criminal defense attorney.
